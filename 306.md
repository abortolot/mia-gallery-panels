**The Pursuit of Pleasure: Europe and America 1700–1800<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>**

If it was good to be the king, it was almost as good to be an aristocrat. Noblemen and women filled their grand European homes with paintings and sculptures that glorified courtly behavior, fashion, and artistic taste. At the same time, the emerging merchant class of New England commissioned art that reflected their own self-image as members of the entrepreneurial elite. American artists turned to European portraiture for inspiration, painting the well-to-do colonists as a kind of New World aristocracy.

The established upper class as well as the newly rich both indulged in hedonistic fantasies. Catering to their voyeuristic tastes, artists depicted famous locales, the sexual escapades of gods and goddesses, and romantic scandals—allegories for the timeless pursuit of pleasure.
