Title: Wood Furniture: Conflict in the Colonies

(*Title your panel*)

Panel Text:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Mahogany, oak, walnut, pine—wood was once as good as gold to Europeans and Americans. Furniture and architectural elements carved from these trees advertised the wealth of their owners, and nations competed intensely for control of the luxury timber trade. <span class="s1">Even the modest American pine—likely composing the London doorway in this room—was jealously guarded by the English crown, which prohibited New England’s colonists from using their own trees.</span>

Oak and walnut, the traditional heroes of European furniture-making, were joined by an American upstart: mahogany. Harvested in Florida and the Caribbean as well as Central and South America, mahogany offered rich color and durability, and artisans preferred its fine grain and carvability for decorative uses. For high-style furniture, it became the first choice on both sides of the Atlantic.

\[I find the graphic confusing because it addresses a trade system that extends above and beyond lumber… and the label text. I had to search for the mentions of wood sandwiched between other goods and slaves to find out how the map related to what I just read.\]
