# Promoting Power through Courtly Arts

****

Medieval and Renaissance rulers used art for publicity, broadcasting their wealth and military might to subjects and rivals alike through lavish ornamentation. Sculpture ennobled their exploits while grand tapestries decorated the public rooms of their residences, illustrating aristocratic values, family pedigree, and key tenets of Christianity, like billboards of identity and power.

Striving to work in courtly service, artists invented new modes of expression. They decorated weapons and fantastic armor for triumphal parades and tournaments. Inspired by ancient Roman statues, they shaped metal and stone into naturalistic portraits, expanding the creative potential of sculpture and making it the most innovative medium of the 1400s.
