# Rococo and Neoclassicism in Europe: 1700 to 1800

French artists and craftsmen in the early 1700s found the decorative styles of the day too timid and restrained, so they developed a new style as playful as its lilting name: Rococo. It was flamboyant and fun, curvaceous and asymmetrical, lightened with pastel colors and luxurious reflective materials—particularly gold—that came alive in the candle-lit evenings. By the 1730s, Rococo had spread throughout Europe.

By the 1750s, however, the tide began to turn. The excavation of the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum—buried in the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 CE—ignited a renewed passion for classical civilization. Artists of the Neoclassical (“New Classical”) style emphasized restraint, symmetry, rich colors, and overtly Greek and Roman motifs. Gradually, their designs entered the Rococo homes of the wealthy and countered the short-lived style with a sense of stateliness.
