(*A statement defining what the gallery is about and informing the panel text. Concrete Subject + Active Verb + Consequence meaningful to visitor*) Rococo and Neoclassicism were dominant stylistic movements in the eighteenth century. Although they were very different in character, they coexisted comfortably in the lived environment. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>

Title:

Rococo and Neoclassicism in Europe: 1700 to 1800

(*max 125 words*)

French artists and craftsmen in the early 1700s found the decorative styles of the day too timid and restrained, so they developed a new style as playful as its lilting name: Rococo. It was flamboyant and fun, curvaceous and asymmetrical, lightened with pastel colors and luxurious reflective materials—particularly gold—that came alive in the candle-lit evenings. By the 1730s, Rococo had spread throughout Europe.

By the 1750s, however, the tide began to turn. The excavation of the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum—buried in the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 CE—ignited a renewed passion for classical civilization. Artists of the Neoclassical (“New Classical”) style emphasized restraint, symmetry, rich colors, and overtly Greek and Roman motifs. Gradually, their designs entered the Rococo homes of the wealthy and countered the short-lived style with a sense of stateliness. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
