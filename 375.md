Big Idea: Figurative painters and sculptors of the 1950s, overshadowed at the time by the Abstract Expressionists, quietly worked to connect the expressive potential of abstract expressionist techniques with the human experience of living in a physical word.

Title: Reconnecting with a Physical World

Panel Text:

The drips, splatters, and color fields of the Abstract Expressionists commanded international attention in the 1950s. The brash, even macho movement was a perfect fit for America’s bold new image on the world stage after World War II.

But many other artists craved a more direct expression of reality, a closer connection to the physical world and the joys and sorrows of being alive in it. They found it in the human figure. While appropriating some elements of Abstract Expressionism—using color to trigger emotion, savoring the rough marks of artist’s tools—they countered the movement with their own, quieter take on the human experience.
