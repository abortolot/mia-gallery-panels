# The Golden Age of Dutch Painting

Money and freedom. It’s an explosive combination that has often fueled creative booms, and in the 17th century it propelled the Netherlands to new artistic heights. With Catholic Spain embroiled in a religious war with Holland, many artists left the Spanish-run territories of the southern Netherlands (now Belgium) for that northern Protestant province, a haven of prosperity. Dutch maritime trading ships circled the globe, bringing unprecedented wealth to the small country, and artists thrived under the patronage of affluent, cosmopolitan clients. 

Golden Age artists generally favored secular scenes over religious imagery and often specialized in a particular subject, like portraits, landscapes, or still-lifes. They could afford to—there was a market for every niche. But more versatile artists like Rembrandt succeeded in creating astonishingly powerful works in every genre.
