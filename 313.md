Rome was the capital of the art world in the 17th century. Tourists and artists flocked to the city to study its celebrated artistic monuments, particularly those from antiquity and the Renaissance. Nearly every artist whose work is displayed in this gallery—including four from France, one from Holland, and two from Flanders—spent time in Rome, living and working among its treasures.

As these artists learned from each other’s work, a shared style emerged. Its common characteristics include theatrical narratives with large-scale figures, emphatic gestures, and dramatic lighting. The influence of ancient Greek and Roman art was also important. This is exemplified by the masterpiece at the center of this gallery, Nicolas Poussin’s *Death of Germanicus,* one of the most important works in the museum’s collection.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
