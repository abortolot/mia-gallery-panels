# A New Way of Seeing: Modern Art in the 20th Century

The paintings and sculptures in this gallery are of the sort that inspired surrealist poet Comte de Lautréamont to describe modern beauty as “a chance encounter between a sewing machine and an umbrella.” Playful, abstract, mysterious—they are alive with imagination and intelligence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Though the artworks appear to have no connection to one another, in style or subject, many of the artists who created them lived in Paris at the same time or at least knew of each other’s work. They burned with the same fever for experimentation. In the process, they forged entirely new forms of art characterized by unconventional juxtapositions of color and shapes, and the manipulation of everyday objects. Their new perspectives expanded the definition of art itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
