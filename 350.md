# European and American Silver

In early Colonial times, wealthy Americans first began collecting silver and only later sought out paintings and sculptures. They considered furniture and ceramics to be primarily practical goods, and not especially valuable. But they prized silver objects and kept them as cherished treasures.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Silverware had been imported to the New World from Europe, particularly England, since the start of the American colonies. But beginning in the 1700s, more and more silversmiths opened workshops on the East Coast, especially in New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. Faced with the possibility of their creations being melted down and cast into new, more fashionable designs—or cash—silversmiths strove to create masterworks. Only the most amazing, they knew, stood a chance of survival.
