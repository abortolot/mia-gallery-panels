Big Idea: As approaches to Impressionism shifted, the important question became “How do *I* see this?” rather than “How do I *see* this?” as artists began to explore their own personal responses to a subject.

In the 1870s, the Impressionists tried to record the fleeting light and colors of nature. A decade later, their responses became more personal, and they gradually left realism behind. The question of “How do I *see* this?” became “How do *I* see this?” as they began to exaggerate color, texture, and pattern to match their emotions.

This was true for many of the first Impressionists (Monet, Cézanne, Pissarro) and for the Post-Impressionist generation that succeeded them (van Gogh, Gauguin, Seurat). The deeply personal and simplified styles they used to express their unique perceptions often resulted in abstract patterns and flattened scenes, which many people found difficult to appreciate. Their admirers, however, understood that in these difficult new paintings the artists were revealing their souls.
