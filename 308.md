Title:

Court and Society in the 18th Century

Panel Text:

Royal tastes ruled art and fashion in 18th-century Europe. Aristocrats decorated their abodes in the visually exuberant, lavishly expensive mode of the century’s illustrious monarchs, especially Louis XIV of France. The high-spirited Rococo style that predominated in the first decades of the century led to gilded moldings, refined fabrics, and exquisite furnishings embellishing every room—the more over the top the better.

Rococo artists used delicate forms, asymmetrical curves, and skillful painting to set a lively mood. Preferring the decorative over the dramatic, they avoided the serious subject matter of earlier eras in favor of depicting people at play or in the enchanting embrace of idyllic settings.
