Title:

Promise and Potential: American Painting and Sculpture 1800–1900

Panel Text:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

The United States was a fledgling nation, still reckoning with its destiny, when American artists created the paintings and sculptures in this gallery. The promise was palpable: a vast land stretching beyond the horizon, a burgeoning populace, newly won freedoms. Yet the nature of American society—its virtues and role models—was up for grabs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Artists offered some answers. They romanticized the American landscape, celebrating its expansive wildness and potential. At the same time, they declared artistic allegiance to Europe, flocking to France and Italy for training and inspiration. And they proclaimed the political and cultural values of ancient Greece and Rome, melding these classical models of government and artistry with subjects that spoke to the new nation’s soul.
