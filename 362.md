Big Idea: Jewish artists within diverse cultural contexts, and non-Jewish artists from the most varied backgrounds, through their creativity enriched Jewish art and ritual objects, rendering them ever more relevant and meaningful.

Title: Jewish Art and Ritual objects \[please note, however, that as per the donation agreement the gallery's name is "Jewish Art and Culture," although I suppose that the panel may have a different title than the gallery, unless the Advancement Dept. states otherwise\]

Panel Text:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

From the beginning of the Jewish diaspora, when Jews were forced from their ancestral homeland in the Middle East, their art and ritual objects were shaped and reshaped by the cultures where they resettled. The conflict between assimilating into the mainstream society, wherever they found themselves, and their faithful observance of religious traditions often sparked unique and unexpected artistic solutions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

In turn, Jewish artists influenced the cultures they encountered, and objects identified with Jewish society came to be created by non-Jewish artists and craftspeople. Forged in the collision of diverse cultures from virtually the world over, these works epitomize a rich creative exchange, a melding of influences and inspiration into something extraordinary and new.
