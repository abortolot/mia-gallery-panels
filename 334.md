# Arts and Crafts: Simplicity in Design

The simpler the better. That’s the motto of many people today seeking handcrafted, artisan alternatives to industrially made goods, clothing, and even food. But it’s hardly new. In the mid-1800s, artists similarly rebelled against big industry, focusing instead on simple, handcrafted objects for the home. The earliest practitioners in England looked back to the small-scale, workshop-based systems of medieval times and emphasized the natural qualities of their materials.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

By 1890, the Arts and Crafts movement was an international phenomenon, playing out differently in Europe and the United States. Most artisans still emphasized simplicity in design and handmade work, but focused on creating colorful depictions of nature.
