# Global Influence in Early AmericaÂ 

The American colonies were an ocean away from Europe and seemingly farther after declaring their independence in 1776. But they were hardly isolated. European styles influenced American decorative arts through the 18th and 19th centuries. Chairs, dressers, chests, and other home goods flowed into America from overseas. Artisans emigrating from Europe brought techniques that shaped American aesthetics in Old World molds. Yet early American artists were not mere imitators. Furniture makers and craftspeople tweaked European styles to accommodate local tastes and heritage. For instance, the Hadley chest on display here follows European taste in terms of form, but its elaborate decorative carving reflects local Massachusetts flair.
