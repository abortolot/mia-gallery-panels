For centuries, European art had been dominated by naturalism, a depiction of what the eye can see. But by the 1880s, some artists began to see naturalism as complicit in their culture’s growing materialism, science, and obsession with progress. Instead of art that documented exterior reality, the Symbolists wanted art that expressed inner feelings. “Paint not the thing,” the Symbolist poet Stéphane Mallarmé urged, “but the effect it produces.”

Symbolist artists started with a poetic idea—common themes included love, silence, evil, or the cycle of life—then used visual elements (forms, colors, lines) to communicate its mood or feeling. The images they created were not meant to be taken literally. Rather, they were symbols representing inner states of mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
