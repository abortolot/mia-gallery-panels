Panel Text:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century had severed people from the land, indeed their natural state. So after decades of recycling historical styles, one fashionable trend after another, artists and designers coalesced at the end of the century around a global fusion style that sought a fresh connection with nature: Art Nouveau, literally “new art.”

Art Nouveau emphasized curved lines and other references to the natural world, especially plants. And it was tied to several other movements, artistic and otherwise, seeking a renewed harmony with the earth. New dance works, for instance, featured serpentine movements and swirling textiles. Outside the arts, the spectrum of reactions ranged from nudism to less constrictive clothing to simply eating healthy, natural foods.
