(*max 125 words*)

In the 1960s, artists embraced popular culture—advertising, cartoons, television images, celebrity—along with the consumerism that fed it. Lifting directly from this vast pool of media, they created a new style that was quickly branded “Pop Art.” Fresh, lively, and brash, Pop enthusiastically proposed that the everyday world was a fine and fascinating subject for art.

Popular culture is now global. In the age of the Internet and free trade, products and imagery cross borders instantaneously, and artists have evolved a new style to describe this worldwide phenomenon: “Neo-Pop.” Whether made in 1964 or 2004, however, Pop Art can be double-edged, as likely to criticize consumer society for its fascination with celebrity and the superficial as it is to celebrate it.
