Romantic artists were passionately in love with passion.

Title:

The Rise of Romanticism

Panel Text:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

A belief in rationality—in the objective order of things—had guided Western thought since the Renaissance. The Romantic movement that emerged in the late 18th century reasserted emotion and subjective feeling in art, the importance of the heart as well as the head. Dynamic energy, rich color, and dramatic subjects characterized the music, literature, and visual art influenced by Romanticism during its heyday between 1800 and 1830 and throughout the 19th century.

Artists stressed the power of nature, and humanity at the mercy of nature’s multiple moods. Sculptors explored the untamed violence in nature, especially in their portrayal of animals. This fascination with the unknown and exotic extended to people and places, particularly North Africa and the Near East, which colonialism had opened to the European imagination.
