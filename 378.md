# Modernist Furniture

In the late 1800s many architects, designers, and artisans created beautiful yet functional new forms in response to a world utterly transformed by industry. Seeking alternatives to cheap or overly ornamented household goods, some renounced the industrial in favor of the handmade. Others, especially in the 1920s and 1930s, embraced new materials and manufacturing techniques.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Modernism evolved from 1880 to 1940 in six major movements described in the adjoining gallery 379. Looking right to left while facing the platform, you can see Modernism’s chronological development, which maintained a general simplification of form and a focus on geometry. You can also see custom furniture designed by architects for their own buildings, unifying the aesthetic of a space in keeping with the popular Modernist concept of a “total work of art.”
