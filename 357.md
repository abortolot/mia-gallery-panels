# Bending the Rules: Academic Realists 1840–1900

Art schools of the 19th century enforced a kind of time warp, instructing students to revere the art of ancient Greece and Rome. Heroic subjects, depicted with clarity, harmony, and technical polish—like the sculpture in this gallery of an angel kissing a fallen Roman soldier—were the norm. Artists who aspired to show in juried exhibitions, where they might attract the notice of a wealthy collector, dutifully followed the rules.
