Big Idea:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Artists of the 19<sup>th</sup> century studied in art academies that provided rigorous training based on ancient Greek and Roman history, art, and architecture. By the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, some artists challenged academic training and subjects, emphasizing contemporary images of pastoral country scenes, exotic locales, women as modern-day temptresses, and views of ordinary domestic life.

Title:

**Bending the Rules: Academic Realists 1840–1900**

****

Art schools of the 19th century enforced a kind of time warp, instructing students to revere the art of ancient Greece and Rome. Heroic subjects, depicted with clarity, harmony, and technical polish—like the sculpture in this gallery of an angel kissing a fallen Roman soldier—were the norm. Artists who aspired to show in juried exhibitions, where they might attract the notice of a wealthy collector, dutifully followed the rules.

<span class="s1">A new group of “academic realists,” however, preferred to bend the rules by capturing their own time and place. Contemporary</span> subjects appealed to art patrons from the emerging middle class, with the results exploring everything from idealized scenes of country life to glimpses of distant places to portraits of a *femme fatale*, or dangerous female—a reaction to the growing independence of women.
