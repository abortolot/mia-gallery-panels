Minnesota 1900: Art and Life on the Upper Mississippi<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Panel Text:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

(*max 125 words*)

By 1900, Minnesota had become an economic powerhouse, largely on the muscle of the Mississippi River. Artists, architects, and designers were drawn to the Upper Midwest landscape, especially the river, just as the industrialists who had harnessed its power were planning a new museum—the MIA, built in 1915—as a symbol of the area’s progress and prosperity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Local architects produced exquisite furniture that reflected this cross-disciplinary regional arts and design scene. Painters emphasized the psychological states or economic statuses of their subjects and brought a new freshness to their work by using loose brushstrokes and modulated, or altered, colors. Influencing many of these local artists was Robert Koehler, the director from 1893 to 1914 of the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts, now the Minneapolis College of Art and Design.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
