# Art in the Age of Yearning

A spare geometric grid, a lumpy nude, a vulnerable-looking man, and a beef carcass resembling a crucifixion—what could this imagery possibly have in common? They all seek the fundamental, the primal, something more essential than rules about art and society. During the early 20th century, in the heyday of psychoanalysis—a yearning to understand the mind—and experimental approaches to religion, artists pursued new ways to explore emotions, urges, and the human spirit.

Others chose restraint, if for different reasons: Lèger sought to paint like a machine, Mondrian searched for spiritual purity. Most artists explored numerous avenues, a life-long journey exemplified by the art of Henri Matisse.
