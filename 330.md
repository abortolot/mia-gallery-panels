# A Flair for Drama: European Art 1550–1750

****

Viewing these paintings is like watching theater, and it’s no coincidence that modern opera was invented and became immensely popular in the 1600s and 1700s, when much of this art was created. Artists, not content with merely decorative or virtuosic work, were craving a real emotional connection with viewers, so they adapted the dramatic techniques of the theater to amplify the action and power of their paintings.

Painters depicted people as though they were actors on a stage, emoting melodramatically. They arranged their compositions like sets, using tricks of perspective, props, and curtains to frame the action and lead the eye. Some of the paintings even feature an onlooker, reacting to the scene as the artist hoped that viewers would.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
