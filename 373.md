# Identity: Who Are We Now?

Identity, answering the essential question of who we are, has compelled artists from the very beginning. The question remains relevant today, and the answer is increasingly complicated. Cultural, ethnic, and political identities are overlapping as the world shrinks through globalization. Seemingly fixed factors in our identity, such as race, gender, and sexuality, are in flux.

Many of today’s artists focus on the face and the body, our outward presentation of ourselves, a way of exploring these changing notions of identity. Their depictions of faces and figures can be highly realistic or powerfully symbolic—or sometimes both at once. The art that results from these investigations are invitations for viewers to reflect on their own definitions of identity.
