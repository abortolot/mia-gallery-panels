Title: High Fidelity for the Eyes: The Northern Renaissance

Panel Text:

It was a seemingly simple switch. But when painters in northern Europe began using oil instead of egg whites to bind their pigments, art would never be the same. Replacing egg with oil slowed the drying process, and suddenly artists had time to add greater detail and more realistic effects. The world came into focus, and art came closer to imitating life.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

This technical development in the early 1400s coincided with cultural shifts that created an appetite for such realism. Renaissance thinkers scrutinized natural phenomena such as light, shadow, and reflection, while humanists in the church—looking to uplift the human mind and spirit—sought divinity in the physical world. Wealthy businessmen and bankers of the Low Countries (present-day Holland and Belgium) hired artists to depict their opulent possessions knowing that they could capture the gleam of gold and the transparency of glass.
