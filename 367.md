# Exploring a New Dimension

Automobiles, airplanes, and even the theory of relativity changed the way people perceived the world in the early 20th century. Suddenly they could move faster than ever before, peer down from the sky, and—if Albert Einstein was right—even travel, in a sense, through time. Artists were inspired by this new understanding of reality and produced works that challenged our perceptions.

Centuries before, artists had learned to represent three dimensions in flat, two-dimensional paintings through the use of perspective and color. Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque dispensed with those conventions and attempted to show an object from multiple viewpoints at the same time. Because this process revealed the subject’s underlying geometric form, it was dubbed “Cubism” by one unappreciative art critic. Later generations of artists continued to experiment and their works remind us of the subjective nature of reality.
