Modernism: New Directions in Design

Panel Text:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

(*max 125 words*)

In the late 1800s, architects, designers, and artisans responded to changing modern life by rejecting historical styles in favor of several new approaches, from simpler forms to geometric precision to designs inspired by nature. These new forms evolved through six major aesthetic movements from 1880 to 1940, collectively called Modernism. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

This gallery and the adjoining gallery 378 showcase the wide range of Modernism, from objects encrusted with plants and animals to those with streamlined linear contours. The great variety of manufacturing methods, from handmade pieces to objects designed for industrial production, shows the fault lines of Modernism, as some designers returned to the past and others embraced the new.
