Title: **The Golden Age of Dutch Art**

****

Panel Text:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Art flourished in the new Dutch republic of the 1600s. After separating from the Spanish-controlled Southern Netherlands (Flanders, now Belgium), the small, seafaring nation thrived from international maritime trade, and the economic gains were broadly distributed. In neighboring nations, the predominant patrons of the arts were royalty and the Catholic Church. But in the Protestant Dutch republic, the primary patrons were merchants.

Private townhouses might contain as many as 10 to 15 paintings as well as collections of prints. For this market, Dutch artists often worked on smaller canvases, painting portraits, still-lifes, landscapes, and scenes of everyday life. They excelled at representing reality, capturing light, shadow, and surface textures with astonishing accuracy. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
