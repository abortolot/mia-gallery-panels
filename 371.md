# Expressionism in European Art, 1900 to 1945

The world changed more in the first 50 years of the 20th century than it had in the previous thousand. Artists moved just as quickly, reacting to two world wars, rapid industrialization, and the threat of mass destruction by inventing ever more radical art forms. They valued originality, experimentation, and intellectual inquiry, organizing around shared ideas of how art should look and what it should address. The old ways, in art as in science and politics, were under siege—even the nature of art itself. 

The movement known as Expressionism allowed artists to visually express meaning and emotional experience. Two groups of Expressionists emerged in Germany: *Der Blaue Reiter* (The Blue Rider) in Munich and *Die Br**ü**cke* (The Bridge) in Dresden and Berlin. In France, artists explored the world in similarly radical ways, experimenting with the vibrant colors of Fauvism and the complex spatial abstractions of Cubism.
