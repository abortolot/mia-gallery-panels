# Art of the Wild, Wild West

“Go West, young man, go West and grow up with the country,” was the advice American writer Horace Greeley gave to Civil War veterans in 1865. But artists didn’t need to be told to go west. They were already there, exploring, in the early 1800s, lured by a romantic vision of the American West as someplace remote and exotic, a living embodiment of liberty. Motivated by adventure, scientific curiosity, and fortune-seeking, they crossed the vast prairies, forests, mountains, and deserts to document the frontier.

These artists were inspired by what they saw and who they met: cowboys, Native Americans, wildlife, and the evocative landscape. Yet only some of their paintings, sculptures, drawings, and photographs of the Old West are based on fact, the rest on stereotypes and imaginary ideals. It was this mix of myth and reality that defined western life for curious Americans back East and Europeans who shared their fascination with the Wild West.
