Panel Text:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

(*max 125 words*)

World War II changed everything: the way we thought about ourselves, the way we expressed ourselves—the old world had exploded and could never be reassembled. By the 1950s, many artists were responding with fresh ways of communicating spiritual and emotional meaning. They rejected realistic images in favor of abstraction, developing a new pictorial language based on vivid color, energetic brushwork, minimal forms, and found objects.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

These new approaches remain vital as artists today revel in expressive colors, distill their observations into visual essences, or use materials and objects that are heavy with meaning. Their works invite contemplation and are part of a new poetics of abstraction in which pure form, or the essential look of something, is inevitably linked to the world around us.
