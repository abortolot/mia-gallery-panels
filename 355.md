# Impressionism in French Art, 1860–1914

They were young and rebellious, a small group of French artists determined to be painters of modern life. In the 1860s, they began painting outdoors to capture the fleeting effects of light and color. Working in the open—*en plein air*—became crucial to their creation of a radically new art of light, movement, pure color, and pronounced brushwork.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Breaking from studio conventions, they documented life in everyday settings—in the home, on the street, in rustic farmyards—and their spontaneous, sketch-like techniques shocked conservative critics, who dismissed their work as “impressions” rather than finished paintings. Today, these insurgent artists are known as the Impressionists.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
