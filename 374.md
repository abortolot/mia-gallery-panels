# Passages and Places in Contemporary Art

The uprooting of millions of people since World War II has defined recent history. New countries have been carved out of old. Conflict and hope have pushed people across borders, as refugees or immigrants, even as technology has erased borders and brought the world to our fingertips without ever leaving home. National and individual identities are in constant flux.Â 

Displacement, the loss of home, and the erosion of cultural values are now core elements of the modern condition, and recent generations of artists have responded in their work. They have explored the impact of exile and dislocation. They have celebrated the emerging mix of global cultures and identities that characterize our world today. And they have sought to define what it means, exactly, to be somewhere yet connected to everywhere at once.
