For nearly three centuries, beginning around 1500, home was where the art was. Artists and craftsmen splendidly decorated even everyday wares, leading an unprecedented flourishing of domestic design. The humble inkwell became a fantastical centerpiece. Tables and cupboards were built with architectural ideals and materials—slabs of marble for tabletops, thin layers of silver and gold that gave wooden furniture the gleam of precious metal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Bronze sculptures animated the home with nudes and mythical creatures, a reference to the artistic glories of classical Greece and Rome. Other sculptures reached back even further, to the proliferation of life on Earth, suggesting the fecundity of nature and the ripeness of the imagination.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
