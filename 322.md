Title:

Splendor and Abundance: American Landscape and Still Life Painting 1800–1900

Panel Text:

To paint American life, they went to Europe. It was the norm in the 19th century for American artists to cross the Atlantic for academic training and inspiration in the heart of the Western art world. When they returned home, they applied their newfound skills to uniquely American subjects. They celebrated the bucolic countryside where they lived and worked, and showcased the abundance of the land in lush still-life paintings filled with fruits and foliage.

Artists immersed in French art infused American landscapes with the sparkling light, rapid brushstrokes, and brilliant color contrasts of the Impressionist style. Others opted for personal expression, capturing emotion on canvas. Through dark tones and moonlight effects, they crafted dreamlike scenes, poetic visions of an ever-changing natural world.
