# Art and Life on the Mississippi: 1950-1900

In the latter half of the 19th century, artists, writers, and entrepreneurs were bewitched by the poetry and power of the Mighty Mississippi—the great engine of an industrializing America, the backbone of a growing nation. Painters documented the economic boom along the river, some depicting romantic, pre-industrial views while others celebrated the modernization and commerce.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

In the Twin Cities, lumber and flour mills along the river spawned a prosperous middle class. Prominent families began amassing art collections, signaling their newfound status, and came to believe that a young city with the potential for greatness should have a public art gallery. In 1883, they founded the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts, which in 1915 became the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.
