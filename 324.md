# Porcelain: The “White Gold”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

It seemed like magic—a ceramic harder than most yet so fine that light could pass through it. Until the early 1700s, true hard-paste porcelain was scarcely imported to Europe from Asia, where its ingredients and manufacture, limited for hundreds of years to China and Japan, were carefully guarded secrets. For Europeans, it was expensive and mysterious.

Then, in 1709, the mystery was cracked. A German practitioner of alchemy, the mystical pursuit of chemistry and philosophy, had struck “white gold” while experimenting with porcelain recipes. He discovered a key ingredient: kaolin clay, locally sourced in Saxony. A porcelain factory was built in nearby Meissen, followed by several others across the region. During the Seven Years’ War that consumed Europe starting in 1756, the royal French factory of Sèvres became the continent’s leading porcelain maker.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
