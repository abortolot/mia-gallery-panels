# Art of the People

Folk art is the unique and often idiosyncratic work of artists and craftspeople taught not by art schools but by themselves, friends, or relatives. Most of all, folk art is informed by personal experience.

The artists featured in this gallery came from all walks of life. And as they did not receive elite art instruction, their work does not conform to any specific mode of thinking or creating, reflecting instead the common values, aesthetics, and experiences of America at large. Quilters from broad geographical regions recycled similar motifs over several generations. Furniture builders blended methods learned in the “old country” with resources found locally in the United States. Itinerant painters catered to the unique tastes of their rural clientele.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
