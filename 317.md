Panel Text:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Jean Gaillard de la Bouëxière built the Grand Salon in his Paris mansion, around 1735, to be his party room. A tax collector for the French crown, he wanted to show that he could afford to play as hard as he worked. It was here that he and his guests enjoyed music and other diversions at a time when leisure—how, when, and how often you entertained—said everything about you.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

The decorative carvings of the hunt, musical instruments, and personified continents perfectly conveyed his refined interests and his privileged position within the French government. The luxurious gold, crystal, and mirrors reflected not only his wealth but also the candles in the room, amplifying the light so that his parties could carry on late into the night. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
