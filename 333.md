# European and American Decorative Arts

Decorative artworks, from sculpture to embellished household objects, were more than decoration—they were personal. These were the objects of daily life, practical and purposeful, physically handled and sometimes endowed with religious meaning. Artists were charged with elevating them to match the meaning of something so intimate. And because these objects were often the only art in the home, the stakes were high. 

Some of these works were used every day, others marked unique or important life events. They might be made of inexpensive materials or crafted with precious stones and metals. But in every case, artists applied a craftsmanship that transcended mere utility. They strove to infuse ideal beauty not just into the object but the very life of the owner.
