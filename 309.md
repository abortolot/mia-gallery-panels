# The Netherlands and New Wealth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Ships at sea. Well-scrubbed homes. Women in sumptuous clothing. Artists painted these images as symbols of wealth and power for Holland’s middle class in the 1600s. Having freed themselves from Spanish rule, the Dutch reveled in their independent identity and self-determination. Ships sailed from Holland’s thriving ports to present-day Brazil, New York, South Africa, Indonesia, and India, turning the tiny country into a cosmopolitan center of trade.

But the Dutch took nothing for granted. In their art, they balanced pride with propriety. Painters depicted pious hermits lost in prayer and modestly dressed citizens. Their still-lives of exotic foods mouldering on the table both celebrated life’s luxuries and warned of its fragility. This mixture of ambition and humility was fitting for those whose fortunes depended equally on the political tides and ocean winds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
