**The Prairie School: Architecture for Modern Americans<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>**

****

America isn’t Greece or Italy. So why, asked the architects behind the Prairie School movement, were its cities filling up with neoclassical architecture copied from distant ancient temples? In 1890s Chicago, architect Louis Sullivan began pushing back, creating buildings that instead reflected his own time and place, including the natural surroundings. He and his followers, including Frank Lloyd Wright and George Grant Elmslie, also integrated architecture with interior design to seamlessly accommodate the way modern Americans lived.

Elmslie and William Gray Purcell followed Sullivan’s principles when designing the Purcell-Cutts house (1913), a gem of Prairie School style. Part of the museum’s collection, this Minneapolis home is nearby and open to the public the second weekend of every month or by appointment.
